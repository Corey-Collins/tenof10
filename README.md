# READ THIS:
so here is a basic starter project for tenof10 with csv file included.
if you would like to edit this i can make you a contributor but you HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN BRANCH.
you also would need to setup a postresql server with psychopg2, you can modify database server settings in tenof10/settings.py
if you want to learn more / get started playing around with this then either contact me or checkout some sources such as thenewboston Django Tutorial Series or http://djangobook.com/
All html files go into Templates folder. All other files (IMGS, FONTS, CSS, JS, ...) will go into a Static folder
